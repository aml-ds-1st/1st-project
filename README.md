# Analysis of time-series effects on Rail Temperature Prediction Model based on Machine Learning Methods.

## 0. READ ME!

These codes are to analyze time-series effects on rail-temperature prediction model based on Machine Learning.

We use `python`(mostly jupyternotebook) on our code. These codes are developed by `CheolJeong Park`, `Jongwon Yoon`, `Chungsu Han`, `Kwanghyo Lee`.

Raw data(rail temperature and climate data) used on these codes are not provided! (Becacuse of paper issue)

If you need more detailed information or collaborative research, please contact us!
